# Advanced Usage

If youâ€™re packaging your own Sass modules and want to use Sass Fairy in the project. It is best to use direct paths for the `@use` rules to the specific features of Sass Fairy your modules needs.

This ensures that the Sass Compiler is loading only the features required by your package. This may slightly improve your modules load time as well.

For example, imagine you require the `contrast()` from `@sass-fairy/color`, the `@use` rule should be as follows:

```scss
@use '@sass-fairy/color/src/contrast';

@function my-function ($value) {

  @if contrast.contrast($value, '#') {
    // ...
  }

  @else {
    // ...
  }

  @return $value;
}
```
